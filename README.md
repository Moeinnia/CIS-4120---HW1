The skeleton Code was generated by AI. Other than that, the HTML code was written by me, alongside the help of AI as I was learning how to do things. This included me learning how to use <span></span>. The entire code related to the calendar section is completely AI generated since I was clueless on how to do any of it. Regardless, I have gone through the code, and asked it a whole bunch of questions, and I now understand how it works. 
Styles.css skeleton was also generated by AI but was modified pretty extensively, especially for trying to get the section tables for the search results to work properly. Again, the calendar code was entirely by AI.
